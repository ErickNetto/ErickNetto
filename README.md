- 👋 Hi, I’m @ErickNetto, a 19 years old student. I live in south of Brazil and i love cyber security, so i'm trying to get more into programming to get better on it. I can speak Portuguese, English, Spanish and a liiiiittle bit of Russian.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and creating some curriculum with my github too showing the projects i already made, also i will surely use this account to school too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I study Python sometimes too, but not too much.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things i understand and i know i can help.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Gr4y L1z4rd#5332
